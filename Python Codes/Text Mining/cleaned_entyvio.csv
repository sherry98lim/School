ac8313eecf6efa01601d2016d1abade39ba5cf32,I am sure that evil doctors in bed with pharmaceutical companies makes sensational conspiracy theories or headlines I think the reality is thats not likely and its a lot more boring and based on verification and guidelines As I said biologics arent first line treatments I believe patient need disease severity and a patient being unresponsive to lesser treatments are a much stronger precursor to being prescribed a biologic Insurance companies have protocols and procedures to ensure that other medications are tried first Endoscopes before and after treatment are used as qualifiers etc Im sure theres the occasional bad egg out there outliers but the vast majority of doctors have their patients needs at heart Severe nonresponsive cases do warrant fast medication escalation Milder cases do not NIH in the UK is a very different nationally run system that gives individual practices much more overhead and regulations Newer medications are approved more slowly in the UK than usa take entyvio as an example Same goes for newer equipment and procedures Id say usa has quicker access to new treatments ideas and processes The disadvantage is the usa cost and without thorough vetting some new methodologies may not be any better just wasteful The NIH is certainly more cautious Both systems have pros and cons However neither system is full of people with little regard to patient outcomes Moderator Ulcerative Colitis John  37 UC in histological remission Rx Remicade 5mgskg8wks Words containing UC both literally and figuratively sUCk ouch deuce mucus fed lucifer and luck Post Edited iPoop  3302016 110639 AM GMT6,entyvio

30ef15a1cdc6946cf3a65b5ef1afd166309d4bdf,Ive been following your posts the whole time I think you can trust yourself about next steps given all youve been through Its terrible that youve had this ongoing ordeal for so long I commend you for making decisions and managing with all thats unfolded as best you can Theres a shift in mindset at some point if possible for you to put the suffering behind you You are not damaged if you choose to get rid of the jpouch as I see it You gave it its best shot Time to choose life  if you are at that point  a new chapter where you can live forward with so many opportunities ahead and much joy for you You have shown tremendous fortitude every step of the way It will forever make you more compassionate with others who are struggling with their own hardships and will deepen the gratitude you have in your life Just my opinion about whats ahead for you  and sending optimism and much support  as well as my respect and admiration for all youve endured at such a young age UC for 15 yrs For flares I use Cortenemas Prednisone Allergic to mesalamines hives fever 6mp fever Remicade stopped after 6 mos due to joint pains AntiTNF Induced Lupus neuropathy On Entyvio since Oct 2015 so far ok,entyvio
2713b5001e441d7a13756eb8dafae5f0ce78ffb8,Unfortunately insurance decides what meds we take and in what order You might need to try remicade or humira 1st and they do have much much quicker response times than entyvio does All of those meds do have patientcopay assistance cards from the manufacturer Our uc severity determines what meds work and at what doses not work Id wager this flare is just a whole lot more severe than past ones for you were IV steroids are sometimes needed Just make sure youre tested recently for pathogenic causes like c diff as not responding to steroids often is red flag to verify its not an infection infections are worsened by steroids not helped Hang in there it does get better Post Edited iPoop  6162017 95407 AM GMT6,entyvio
965ecdbf6adef73852e4a50a94cb485f92d6622c,Antibodies arent a foregone conclusion with biologics Some never get antibodies to a biologic even without concurrent immunomodulator therapy Some get antibodies quickly with the best concurrent immunomodulator therapy I believe the highest odds of antibody formation is early on in the biologic treatment if its already been years and you havent already got antibodies then you likely wont get them Its easy to test for antibodies and unless they become a problem then theres no reason to discontinue a med Remicadeinfliximab is the oldest ucapproved biologic and its 75 percent human protein and 25 percent mouse protein As such its generally a little higher odds of antibody formation than the rest The rest are 100 percent human and some like entyvio dont even recommend immunomodulators concurrent with treatment with current clinical guidelines Even in the worst case scenario of antibodies drug doses can be increased to counter act in many cases And antibody formation to one medication doesnt predispose one to always developing antibodies to every medication Its isolated to one med Some food for thought at least and I wouldnt fixate on antibodies Moderator Ulcerative Colitis John  38 in a minor flare UC Proctosigmoiditis Rx Remicade 5mgskg8wks 50mgs 6MP 48g Lialda 20mgs pred With UC Ive become a poopninja sly and sightunseen doing what having insane urgency demands Post Edited iPoop  9192016 114922 AM GMT6,entyvio
a8944c1dda45c6389c8e338e9ad2a261ca5a3656,UPDATE I saw IBD Specialist yesterday for my first followup after my colonoscopy on May 2nd 3 weeks ago Let me rewind and say that I have been stressing about this appointment afraid IBD Specialist would give me options I didnt like and then bully me to pick one I have been waiting for test results and honestly looking more and more at surgery I tried to drop from 40mg to 35mg prednisone last Monday and it was awful I had horrible withdrawal symptoms and started bleeding That was very defeating and I knew it was a bad sign I went back up to 40mg and stabilized Actually not doing too badhaving BMs every day this requires dulcolax though and not too much blood My tenesmus is much better and I havent taken any bentyl in over a week Im still fatigued but managing to live my life despite italbeitmy house is messy because somethings gotta give Its great that my symptoms have improved but since Im dependent on the prednisone  humira  cortifoam it really cant be considered a win Here are things we considered when discussing my treatment plan 1 I am TPMT normal and CAN metabolize 6MP  Imuranso these drugs became an option for me 2 I do not have antibodies to HumiraBUT 3 My Humira serum levels were very low they were 2 and IBD Specialist crinkled her nose and said Thats not doing anything for you 4 Because my Humira levels are so low I wouldnt have to wait any amount of time to start a new biologic if thats what we decided 5 So here are the options we discussed A Humira  Imuran B Remicaid  Imuran if I dont have antibodies C Stelara  Imuran D Entyvio  Imuran E Diverting colostomy temp until I heal F Permanent colostomy We discussed the pros and cons of each treatment I waited patiently for IBD Specialist to finish making her flow chart and explaining everything to me before I asked questions and gave input My first question was Am I a candidate for a jpouch And I knew her answer would be No which was correct I immediately eliminated the option of a diverting colostomy stating that if I was going to do surgery then I would choose the permanent surgery since thats ultimately what I want Though I am disappointed that the jpouch is not an option I was happy when IBD Specialist said that surgery IS a very good option for me Since I have never shown inflammation outside the colon she said the chances of me developing disease elsewhere is maybe 2 and that after surgery I would not need to take any meds anymore Woot Ultimately I want a medfree diseasefree life so that is very encouraging I could live the life I want to live with an ostomybarring complications But Im not ready for surgery yet I told her Ive been researching and reading peoples stories and Im encouraged because even people who have complications tend to be happy they had the surgery I was afraid of recovery time but I see that most people feel better immediately and are active within a week or so after surgery However Im having trouble getting excited about it I want to feel good about it but Im still struggling to imagine life with an ostomy and I am scared of complicationsif it didnt turn out the way I planned IBD Specialist totally understood I told her I like the Humira because I do think it has helped meI was much worse on steroids aloneand I like that I have no side effects I have been wanting to try adding 6MPImuran to see if that can help me wean from the prednisone So Humira  Imuran is my first choice She said ok no problem We eliminated Remicaid altogether because my response to it wasnt that goodI still had to use Rowasa enemas If the Humira  Imuran doesnt allow me to get off prednisone we chose Stelara  Imuran as my next drug therapy mostly because Stelara works more quickly than Entyvio But I am considering just going straight to an ostomy if the Humira  Imuran fails It really just depends on how things go Something clicked during this visit When I got in my car to leave I didnt cry or feel scared or confused I felt relieved Because surgery isnt sounding so bad I am starting to have a positive vision of my life with an ostomy My family is going on vacation from June 410th and I asked her to keep things stable until I returned because I want to enjoy it IBD Specialist said Of course and told me to just add the Imuran but dont worry about dropping the prednisone until I get back I appreciated that I will have blood drawn for monitoring on June 2nd and then I will see IBD Specialist on June 16th and have blood drawn again I need to get a flu shot and a pneumonia vaccination I am nervous about getting on a plane and also going to Disneyland remember the measles outbreak while on 40mg prednisone  humira  imuran On the other handmy immune system is relentless and Im physically pretty strong right now so chances are good that I will be fine But any suggestions on how to stay healthy while traveling are appreciated So what do you think guys 37yr female dx UC 04 dx changed

3097e8d96490564b8828c0c78d8bc68ddde92c95,From exploring the forums if one thing is clear its that no 2 patients symptoms are the same But I find myself at a cross roads of starting biologics without having a 100 certainty I do in fact have crohns In short since 2015 I have had 23 flare a year of severe RLQ pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea loose to watery Each flare is resolved with 23 weeks of steriods and diet modification I take Lialda for maintenance but still experience RLQ pain almost daily and nausea and vomiting after I eat Since 2015 I have lost approx 70lbs Last colon and EGD scope was 2016 with non specific inflammation and nothing to impressive on the biopsy My last major flare was in June after being off the Lialda for a few months at that time my WBC count was 17K and the CT showed enteritis  ileus in my small bowel with possible colitis My old GI was somewhat leaning to IBD but reluctant to start any treatment I felt it was best to get a second opinion my current GI is fairly certain based on my history and CT findings that I most likely have crohns in my small bowel that is not accessible to the scopes He feels its best to start Entyvio being that I continue to have symptoms RLQ pain low grade temps nausea vomiting after eating says he has had patients with the same story So my question to the forum has anyone else been diagnosed based on symptoms and non specific lab and imaging Even though its safer of the biologics it does not come with out risk and of course the expense and want to do whats best for myself and family,entyvio
b623f1363ec20ef89b2e78bc4b9ccbba84d275cd,Sorry for the delayed response Well overall my UC isnt as bad as some people Ive seen with it I havent had blood present in any BMs or the sort since my first true flare up back in SeptemberOctober According to my GI there was some improvement in what he saw and overall the Entyvio is the first drug that has actually truly helped me Not counting the Devils TicTacs I have absolutely noticed a massive quality of life improvement since going on Entyvio in January One of the main motivators for me getting this surgery was due to the descript ion my doctors gave me They basically said that once I have the surgery after recovery time that its all good No drugs no infusions and essentially no more UC because well I dont have a large intestine anymore As I look around I notice a lot of people with Jpouches who are still on UC forums and pages Now I know a lot of those people are there to help others still with the disease but I wonder Im trying to get a truly accurate picture of life postop I mean why would someone who no longer has a large intestine still be on entyvio and meslamineWhen I tried to ask this person they never responded Does UC truly go away after this surgery or is it one of those asterisk kind of situations quoteHow bad is your disease Has it reached a point where most of the potential complications wouldnt be any worse than what you have right now or are the symptoms liveable with As I mentioned earlier my disease isnt as detremenal for me as it is for others but I do have a lot of problems still I still go more than I feel I should I am always fatigued and have a screwed up sleep cycle a lot of this has to do with the drugs I am onPrednisone being the primary offender Where I am on the cusp the most is that I am 22 years old I graduated college a month ago and am trying to start my professional career I am even in the hiring process for a position right now that If I got it it would be a year of solid training before graduating the academy A flare up would be devastating and would ultimately result in me either resigning or being laid off ADA wouldnt protect me given that its a sworn position apparently My doctors and parents both feel its best I just have this surgery and be done with it if it truly means that UC the drugs flare ups etc are all behind me for good I just really do not want to do this surgery and see my quality of life go backwards,entyvio

623ce3f6b116ff34123f08a10be2028064fb7fcf,Reply posted for dmrunner1010 First question Whats the diagnosis Colitis or Crohns If he has colitis you could consider mesalamine It comes in a few different flavors Suppositories enimas or pills I used to be on the pills and suppositories and they worked well for at least 8 years past my diagnosis The advantage of these is that they are topical antiinflammatory drugs and do not compromise the immune system Most people dont have side effects I never had any That all said theres no biologic drug that compromises the immune system worse than prednisone if Im not mistaken Ive been through 3 different classes of them and now Im on a 4th Remicade to Simponi similar to Humira to Entyvio and now Im using Xeljanz Typically patients with UC will go through biologics in that order and only start biologics if the other options fail For my disease I believe that every drug Ive ever used was effective at least for a while But I never put myself in a bubble Im doing just fine at the moment Typically I might have to deal with a common cold for a little bit longer than most At worst I got a shingles outbreak a couple months ago but that was more due to being on prednisone for longer than expected than anything else after a nasty flare up thats now under control I recommend seeing a doctor that is not just a GI but an IBD specialist Google search IBD clinic plus the nearest state university to you Ever since I started seeing specialists in universities on the cutting edge of treatments for IBD Ive been treated far more effectively than before,entyvio

584ef188062602fa43bd28333d2c8694ab5ddd42,If its the Remicade causing the lupus druginduced lupus called DILE then stopping the Remicade is necessary But its hard to know how quickly the DILE will go away once you stop the Remicade Remicade isnt approved to treat lupus but it is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis And many people with lupus have significant arthritis manifestations So in a sense it can be used to treat a manifestation of lupus But when a person is already on Remicade and only then develops symptoms of lupus its obviously not a good treatment Its more likely a cause especially given the antihistone antibodies being present So your pcp andor rheumatologist are getting confused somehow As for how long to wait before starting Entyvio when was your last Remicade infusion Entyvio can be slow to act several weeks even a few months to kick in so it might make sense to start it sooner rather than later,entyvio

apparently Im doing so well at work that theyre already scheduling me to close by myself So I technically have 3 jobs My writings with IBD News Today are still going well I had a few weeks off just because of the holidays being on the weekends With Veterans Day and Thanksgiving they had two Fridays off which meant two Fridays of no articles needed from me I wrote about insomnia this week since it seems to be a common problem Id suffered from it and had been wanting to write about it for a while and finally got around to it Im used to writing a series of columns but with the holidays Im choosing to do individual articles I am still writing with Everyday Health too with four articles submitted and another I have to write I do enjoy writing for this website because I get paid significantly more but there was a problem with my first payment so I have yet to be paid Itll be exciting when I do its somewhat a validation that my writings are important and kind of significant for the cause research and education of Crohns disease and IBD And now in between working Ive gotten to see and speak to a few doctors about all of my Crohns disease issues and other ailments Starting toptobottom my migraines have been helped so much upping my medication dose one more pill nortriptyline my left side of my brain has not been killing me Every now and then Ill feel one start to come on and of course I jumped to get my Imitrex but I think we finally got that under control For my hands and joints they ache Every single day at work I have to make sure I have my brakes or I am going to be in some significant pain My right hand and thumb not the one with the ganglion cyst we did not really look at it when I went to see MSK We were more focused on looking at my ganglion cyst and my right hand wasnt really causing me any pain at that point but now I have to make sure I have my brace on it because it aches and radiates throughout my entire hand Im thinking it has a cyst right on the joint of the thumb where it connects to the hand but we havent looked at it yet   Work and Scheduling Appointments  It Could Be Worse Blog  Mary Horsley  Ganglion Cyst  Lumpy the Ganglion Cyst A Trilogy  It Could Be Worse  Mary Horsley My left hand and thumb the one with the ganglion cyst that we aspirated a month ago the ganglion cyst has come back It grew back to the same size almost immediately which is kind of depressing I was hoping for a few months of relief before the ganglion cyst would even try to come back but were a little amount of fluid was left in the wrist Im thinking it just helped it fill back up to its old size I had an appointment originally scheduled in January for them to look at it at MSK on the same day as my next infusion if I get it to check the status of the ganglion cyst returning but they told me I could call before then if it came back sooner Which it has So I called the VA this week and asked for them to schedule me a consult with the surgeon rather than having to have another appointment just to see MSK when we already discussed a referral to surgery This would save me from an appointment in the long run The VA called me back and told me that my referral for surgery was put in I will have to have a consult with them first which is scheduled early January I am definitely not looking forward to having any kind of surgery let alone in my hands because I use them so much but if it can bring me relief then I believe it is worth it I have read studies where people have remaining or permanent pain after having their cyst removed scar tissue inside their hands causing pain or the cyst getting larger than originally thought but everything has its risks I suppose I do have to go and have my hands xrayed before my surgery consult and I do have to go and do my preop consult for my colonoscopy coming up in a few weeks Ill get that done this upcoming week And as for my Crohns I had my Entyvio Infusion 5 last Monday which always goes by so slow for a quick infusion I sit there and I listen to my music or I talk to my sister this time it does make me drowsy and I was extremely sleepy on the way home but oddly enough I could not nap I woke up the next day feeling like hell run over   I was supposed to work Tuesday but I have warned my boss that I would feel bad I had changed the schedule to have off a few days off this week but that didnt happen I ended up taking Tuesday off because I felt so bad I get really drowsy and sleepy and my body feels like its been beaten with no bruises showing Its a 100 guarantee that I am going to bleed after an infusion Any infusion I have ever gotten  plus those Humira shots  I know a few days after I will have some significant blood loss And its coming from my bottom if you didnt catch that No one should ever see blood this way Its always a shock you never really get used to it and it makes you sick to your stomach to see It is now almost a week after my infusion and Im still having blood loss so I may have to call GI and give them a little update I know before my infusion I always have to get there early to get blood tests done and all the enough they tested me for TB with the

Ive never done but when I looked at My HealtheVet website there was no appointment in place so I asked during my infusion and my nurse looked it up She couldnt find it either   So she called up to GI and they ended up having to schedule me on the 20th Its only a week and a half later but its still something Id rather just get done and be done with it My scope isnt until 1 in the afternoon which is significantly later than I like I am going to be miserable irritable and starving It ended up working out because now I have to get my xrays and preop done on the 8th so scheduling ended up working

0d8db5dc0bebd5ed851570510a874455bb929fcd,Hi all Its been a while I was nearly going to have my first surgery 9 years ago when I tried Humira as a last ditch attempt to avoid it I was getting blood transfusions every couple months and I was as thin as a rail Needless to say Humira was a miracle Ive gained 30 lbs this is a good thing my haemoglobin and iron have been normal and for the most part Ive felt great and have lived a full and normal life Anyway the past 5 days havent been so good and tonight I did some catching up on treatments in case the Humira is not going to keep working Honestly I wonder if Im getting therapeutic benefit at all from the Humira since Ive been taking it for 9 years and I could have developed antibodies Its great to see there have been at least a couple new treatments added Anyway I took one dose of Remicade 16 years ago  back when they just gave you one treatment It worked great right away but then of course the benefit wore off I know there used to be concern that infrequent use of Remicade can increase the likelihood of antibodies Is this still the current thinking I was thinking that since Remicade worked for me before and because its an antiTNF like Humira  it might be a good next step Then I could keep the newer options like Stelara and Entyvio in my pocket for possible future use What are your thoughts Its nice to recognize some familiar names Ides straydog NCOT 73monte beave Mike  42 yo male Dxed in 1999 No surgeries Current meds Humira 22709 Proferrin iron pills Flax oil probiotic Pervious meds 6MP some success MTX nightmare AsacolPentasa useless No gluten Post Edited Rider Fan  5302018 104847 PM GMT6,entyvio

Like most rows it was also about something completely stupid and petty on the surface But its relevant to this thread so Im gonna talk about it  Ill try not to make it too long  I showed my parents my capsule endoscopy report My mum squirmed at the inflammationulcers and said urgh how horrible Told them what I basically told you guys that as far as I could tell I had exhausted my medical options so basically either had to live with the Crohns or go back to a stoma They were sympathetic and that in itself wasnt the cause of the row Went to the garden centre with my mum we had a nice afternoon But when we got back she got on the wine I dont think she is an actual alcoholic but shes one or two tiers below being one Ive noticed that when I go over there she is drinking more and more often in the evenings now So far up until last night theres been no issue I know from long experience my mum is in deep denial about her drinking and will be until the day she dies And most of the time shes all right when drunk if a bit annoying But sometimes she gets into this awful argumentative state where she just seems to be spoiling for an argument So it was last night She asks if Im coming over for Easter Sunday Im not keen on the idea Now my feelings on family gatherings are nothing remotely new or surprising to my mum I always feel like physical crap after eating a large meal  virtually always This is something that I think people really dont understand My family perk up after eating a massive meal and drinking alcohol  they get ever louder and shriekier Whereas I get tireder lower and just want to go and lie down So my mum argued with me over that saying I dont always feel like crap and citing one or two examples where I didnt appear to obviously collapse Now I cant remember who brought up my brother first me or my mum But somebody did and then it turned into the most ridiculous argument about how ill my brother was I think some of you here know he has Crohns as well since I mention it from time to time But hes had his disease for longer than Ive had mine hes also had a far milder form Im not close to my brother Hes never given me any sympathy for my disease and Ive never given any sympathy for his We dont fight or anything like that were just like two polite acquaintances with one another Anyway my mum was trying to tell me how my brother has been very ill as well despite the fact that hes never had surgery never been hospitalised never been on biologics seems to be in remission the vast majority of the time has always worked fulltime had two kids plays sports goes on holidays eats anything etc But yeah hes the very ill one Dont get me wrong Im sure he has his problems nobody can reach middle age and not have acquired some problems along the way But I proper lost my temper at that I would never tell my brother to his face how lucky he has been with his disease but I told my mum However she was quite drunk by then its hard enough to get through to her when shes sober sometimes never mind drunk I ended up in a proper sobbing meltdown something Ive not had in a couple of years My dad then joined in the fun and started getting verbally aggressive Both my parents were desperately trying to get me to leave for several minutes Then my mum gave up and went upstairs and I was left sobbing in the hallway My dad then had a volte face and said I wasnt safe to drive like that He became gentler and went and made me a cup of tea I calmed down enough to drive home but yeah  that was a proper grim night and I felt proper upset when I got home  Well that was way longer than I intended it to be sorry folks  I have read all your replies In fact I read some of them last night but obviously wasnt in much of a fit state to reply Thank you to everyone who posted Erudite Paul  Yeah its possible for the pill cam to get stuck in a stricture Thats why in Crohns they tend to give the patient a dummy pill first that dissolves in case it does get stuck I had the dummy pill never saw it pass so I had an abdominal xray but they couldnt see the pill  so I was given the goahead to go ahead with swallowing the real pill clo and sparkleplenty  I had the pill cam after the 3 loading doses of Entyvio Since then had a 4th infusion and am due to have a 5th infusion next week Im not sure if thats enough time for Entyvio to kick in or not Ill have to ask my GI about it noodlesnoodles  I think so but not sure if Tysabri is approved for Crohns or not Yet another thing to ask my GI about  nssg  I was on a long course of Entocort last year It did actually help at 9mg But as with all steroids it only worked for me at the highest dose and stopped working before I had even fully come off the med Im just done with steroids they are literally sticking plasters only for me beave  I can certainly travel to London for treatment if necessary I can get there in an hour on the train 19 seconds seemed quite fast to me  I dont know I looked up the symptoms of achalasia I do occasionally get a feeling of food being stuck or of finding something quite hard to swallow but not most of the time Anyway Id better go now guys Ive got my hospital appointment to get to Ill let you know how that goes Sorry for yet another hideously long post it always looks shorter in the white box Dx Crohns in June 2000 Yay   Tried 5ASAs azathioprine 6MP Remicade methotrexate

2ebf74d42062c915298458a9eea88014d66da1c7,When youre diagnosed with a chronic illness like ulcerative colitis UC you quickly start to realize theres more to it than just managing the symptoms of the disease  UC can bring planned and unexpected costs and paperwork To help keep your stress levels low here are HealthCentrals best financial and paperwork tips and strategies to make the other side of UC management a little easier   iStock Open an HSA account An HSA or health savings account  is a great way to help ease the financial burden of UC HSA accounts let you add pretax dollars to the account so that you can use that money to help pay for prescriptions and other verified healthrelated purchases For instance if you know how much youll spend on your prescriptions within a year you can add that amount with pretax dollars to your HSA to spend on your prescriptions saving money in the long run   iStock Use a payment plan Sometimes the unexpected can occur and you dont have quite enough money to cover the cost of a colonoscopy or other emergency procedure In this case work with the hospital or medical agency to figure out a payment plan and schedule This can help you tackle major costs without wiping out your savings or checking account Make sure to keep a record of how much youre contributing each month   iStock Expect the unexpected with an emergency fund If you dont want to wind up in the make payments boat you can create an emergency fund Open an additional savings account at your bank and either make a monthly contribution to it or if you have direct deposit set aside an amount per paycheck to go directly into your savings account That way if you do have a flare or other unexpected issue you have a balance to draw from Make sure your contributions fit into your budget   iStock Check out prescription assistance programs Many biologic prescriptions like Entyvio  offer rebate programs or assistance programs that can help lower the cost of the biologic itself or other prescriptions You can also check out Blink Health to see if their services cover your prescriptions This can be a huge cost savings if youre on multiple medications or your insurance doesnt cover a medication prescribed by your gastroenterologist   iStock Consider new insurance Sometimes you might need to consider new insurance coverage in order to better manage your finances when it comes to your UC If your current insurance provider doesnt cover your prescriptions blood work colonoscopies or other procedures it might be time to switch If youre using a companyprovided insurer talk to your HR representative to see if theres a way for you to get better coverage If youre unemployed look into COBRA to see if you can get coverage until your disability benefits are approved or you go back to work   iStock Create a physical UC folder UC brings a lot of paperwork along with it A great investment is an accordion folder It doesnt cost much but with these folders you can save all the documentation and paperwork related to your UC in an organized manner Whether thats prescription receipts test results doctor recommendations or other medical purchase information you can keep all your UC records in one place The added benefit This can really help during tax season   iStock Participate in a PPO if you make a lot of visits Another insurance option is to partake in a PPO insurance program if you make a lot of office visits  PPOs can help reduce the cost of copays when you visit your specialists If you have UC and see multiple specialists consider a PPO and choose innetwork providers This can greatly reduce the cost of your visits and you can potentially have a network of providers that can share your medical records with each other so they can stay informed   iStock Use a budgeting app A great way to prevent surprise costs is through a budget If youve never created a budget before using an app like Mint or EveryDollar can be a great way to help you get started With your budget you can see where your expected monthly costs are where your money is going and get a better idea on how much you need to save in your emergency fund Mint and EveryDollar both sync with your bank account and any credit card accounts you might have and take a lot of the guesswork out of budgeting   iStock Manage your medical records online through a patient portal Most doctors keep your records electronically now and quite a few employ the use of a patient portal An online patient portal can help you manage all of your test results correspondence with your care team bills and test requests all in one place If your doctors use an online patient portal take advantage of it Its a great way to communicate with your doctor and keep a record of those conversations so you can better work on your treatment plan   iStock Choose tools that work for you Managing all of the paperwork and bills that come with living with UC can be complex but its all about choosing tools that work for you Everyones UC management is going to look a little different Some might have the flexibility to pursue other insurance options and some might prefer to keep all their records electronically Your plan is up to you but know there are tools available to make your life easier,entyvio

4df15fb1d435902728edd0473e7a0c8890cba9a1,Juststud the way the stem cells work is that they repair the damaged tissues in the colon and they in a way reset the immune system so that the immune system doesnt attack the healthy gut which creates inflammation and ulceration Also I would like to add I had to stop my entyvio infusion a months before this treatment and any anti biotics The beginning dose which is the two infusions is in a way a loading dose Right after every infusion I felt very sleepy and I went to sleep literally right after I got it They say this is a normal reaction and not to be worried It takes 46 weeks to see results from the treatment but some people can see improvement immediately in time it gets better because the stem cells keep working to repair the damaged tissue imagardener2 I dont believe there will be stem cell therapies available in the US because these treatments arent FDA approved Yes there are other counties who conduct this treatment I know Ukraine Panama Mexico Switzerland have stem cell treatments available There are probably more but Im just listing the ones Im aware of iPoop the treatment cost 18000 but I know it varies where you go the cost might be different I know in other places it costs less but we decided to go to panama because we actually have family friends who went there for other medical conditions with promising results gutsareus I appreciate your kind words and thank you very much notsosicklygirl all I can say is theyre not allowed to use the word cure but the fact Im not taking any medication feels like a cure to me DBwithUS the information you provided is correct and thank you for posting it 20 years old Diagnosed UC May 2011 Irritable Bowel Syndrome September 2012 Current MedsAzulfidine 6 tablets a day zantac 150 mg started entyvio 1272016 prednisone 20 mg tapering CBD oil,entyvio

e7e8edad6678a3a60a0f3a5110c35d7cefeae428,Holy crap  Your story sounds exactly like mine I was also hospitalized in December 2017 lost a ton of weight within a couple weeks had a really bad nonresponsive reaction to Prednisone etc Unsure if youre in Texas or not since your name but I am The only thing that helped me was honestly finding a different GI team The first hospital I went to misdiagnosed me the second one released me entirely too early and my body couldnt handle the pill forms of the medications I was on Eventually I was readmitted to the same hospital My GI doctor came in and told me she needed to step over the line to save my colon and transfer me to a better hospital that could handle my problem with more expertise I was transferred to UT Southwest William P ClementsZale Lipshy they had my symptoms improving within three days The other hospital literally just kept me in a dark room for two weeks with a steady drip of morphine What they did that helped me the MOST was take me off of Prednisone and put me on a pill biologic Tacrolimus Tacrolimus and Bentyl were my live savers I was on a ton of antibiotics and Valcyte even Eventually when my liver was strong enough to begin an infusion plan Remicade JACKED me up I went to Entyvio Since December I was able to ditch about 14 prescript ions I currently take Bentyl Uceris and get Entyvio every 8 weeks Also bought some slippery elm people in here talk about it a lot and it REALLY helps  Bought some Biotin gummies from Amazon which I read can help with the hair fallout because my hair is EVERYWHERE and its destroying my soul and making me so sad But I guess when you have a super bad UC flare it puts your hair into a funky dormant stage Usually when your hair begins to fall out its always from a previous flare months before I read that it can be a sign of healingmaking room for new growth If youre in the DFW area I can get you some good GI informationThe teams here saved my life 27 years old  Female Diagnosed  December 2017Ulcerative Pancolitis Spent DecemberFebruary in the hospital Treatments Remicade severe liver damage stopped treatment immediately Prednisone caused severe weight gain as well as swollen feet and legs become nonresponsive Valcyte to kill my CMV infection Tacrolimus bridging biologic medication Entyvio currently on dose 3,entyvio

driving to work and there was emergency pothole construction and I was stuck in traffic for two and a half hours and eventually I had to pull over to the side of the road to poop on the side of the road It was all over my pants So I had to buy sweatpants at the college bookstore in which to teach I still have those sweatpants as a reminder of those bad old days But your doctor will work with you to develop strategies to bring down the inflammation Many many people live long energetic lives working to fulfill their own purpose Can I or anyone else guarantee that the eventualities you mention will not occur No Only your doctor can work with you to give you really good answers to your questions But while you are waiting to hear from more knowledgeable people than I you are likely to hear

Posts  13436 Posted 7142017 541 AM GMT 6 See my inline responses in green below  June4th said I may very well have UC Will I need a colostomy bag 75percent of UC patients do not need colectomysurgery removal of large intestine and only 25 do ultimately need that surgery So the odds are against you ever needing one As an FYI the defacto surgery for UC is called a jpouch procedure and the end result enables pooping as you do now without an appliancecolostomy bag Jpouch involves creating an internal pouch with the end of the small intestine to store stool and attaching it to the rectal sphincter muscles You can hold poop for a long time and urgency and other UC symptoms are gone  Life span There is no statistically significant difference in life span between UC patients and the rest of the population You should live just as long as your peers despite your UC diagnosis  Increased colon cancer risks 97 percent of us do not get colorectal cancer and only 3 percent of us ultimately do get it Odds are in your favor here The two factors that impact our CRC odds are UCseverity and time since initial diagnosis Our CRC odds increase the longer weve had UC After 10 years since our diagnosis we are screened annually or biannually via colonoscopy to counter tgat increased risk Proctitis patients those with only UC in their rectum have no statistically significant increased risk of CRC Proctosigmoiditis rectum and sigmoid colon involvement have increased CRC risk and pancolitis whole large intestine involvement have a greater risk CRC is generally a slow grower so theres time to catch it infact increased screenings usually catch precancer abnormal changes dysplasia and remove the large intestine for treatment before it turns to a cancer  Wear diapers Accidents from crazy urgency are a concern on our minds Many of us have never worn diapers some have briefly during the worst of their flares near incontinence until a solution was found and they healed very few wear them on a regular ongoing and indefinite basis surgery often comes well before that  Anything else UC increases our odds of having skin problems joint pains eye problems and increases our risk of blood

uncertainty sucks but odds are that youll fare much better than the visuals your worried mind currently presents Not only that but stress seems to be our worst enemy The best thing to do if one has health anxiety is to dwell upon the folks here who have positive outcomes and try and assume your situation will be ok too I am by no means attempting to belittle your perspective on the contrary as I too spent some time worrying about worst case scenarios But when the dust settled I realized that I was causing myself a host of unintentional misery by projecting crappy outcomes Just learn as much

look at the cumulative risk and not just the risk time sliced into periods wwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed11247898 Gut 2001 Apr48452635 The risk of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis a metaanalysis Eaden JA1 Abrams KR Mayberry JF Author information Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS Controversy surrounds the risk of colorectal cancer CRC in ulcerative colitis UC Many studies have investigated this risk and reported widely varying rates METHODS A literature search using Medline with the explosion of references identified 194 studies Of these 116 met our inclusion criteria from which the number of patients and cancers detected could be extracted Overall pooled estimates with 95 confidence intervals CI of cancer prevalence and incidence were obtained using a random effects model on either the log odds or log incidence scale as appropriate RESULTS The overall prevalence of CRC in any UC patient based on 116 studies was estimated to be 37 95 CI 3242 Of the 116 studies 41 reported colitis duration From these the overall incidence rate was 31000 person years duration pyd 95 CI 21000 to 41000 The overall incidence rate for any child was 61000 pyd 95 CI 31000 to 131000 Of the 41 studies 19 reported results stratified into 10 year intervals of disease duration For the first 10 years the incidence rate was 21000 pyd 95 CI 11000 to 21000 for the second decade the incidence rate was estimated to be 71000 pyd 95 CI 41000 to 121000 and in the third decade the incidence rate was 121000 pyd 95 CI 71000 to 191000 These incidence rates corresponded to cumulative probabilities of 2 by 10 years 8 by 20 years and 18 by 30 years The worldwide cancer incidence rates varied geographically being 51000 pyd in the USA 41000 pyd in the UK and 21000 pyd in Scandinavia and other countries Over time the cancer risk has increased since 1955 but this finding was not significant p08 CONCLUSIONS Using new metaanalysis techniques we determined the risk of CRC in UC by decade of disease and defined the risk in pancolitics and children We found a nonsignificant increase in risk over time and estimated how risk varies with geography Late 50s male dxd with UC in 2003 Standard therapy is now

with UC are at increased risk for Colon Cancer as Richard points out On the positive side colon cancer is treatable On the other hand some UC medications have a risk of a rare and aggressive cancer called HSTCL Hepatosplenic TCell Lymphoma This cancer is very rare and aggressive and being it is quite uncommon there are not a lot of options for treatment The prognosis is quite dismal and often ends in death Unsuccessful Surgery about 20 of people with UC end up having surgery I did Mine has been successful and I am living SO much better than I did the entire time I had UC Unfortunately not all surgery is successful You have to be realistic and realize that over 95 of people only regret not having surgery sooner even people who opt for permanent ostomies but the 5 of people who end up worse off can be in dire straights Either they continue to suffer with UC symptoms they are diagnosed with Crohns they have short bowel and they end up unable to eat constantly going 2 suffering blockages on tons of drugs Septic Shock Either from fulminant UC or medications If you have very severe UC that is unresponsive to treatment you could end up with a bowel perforation that can lead to sepsis The drugs themselves weaken your immune system and leave you susceptible to infection and sepsis Worse than sepsis is septic shock this happened to me from UC drugs Septic shock is very serious and can lead to organ failure and ultimately death enwikipediaorgwikiSepticshock Severe UC A life with severe UC is pretty terrible if its not responsive to treatment If it gets bad enough a person could literally be frightened to leave their house Even with a diaper its humiliating smelly expensive and youre walking around with diaper butt Over time you lose friends family spouse career options You end up sick alone destitute unable to get insurance unemployable in pain making 30 trips to the toilet day  night with zero notice on tons of drugs that make you feel terrible and you cant afford and the cherry on top is the consideration that this illness is genetic so you will likely pass it on to any children you have  they can look forward to all the same worst case scenarios possibilities

but those situations are highly improbable outliers and very unlikely to happen to you or to I None of us anticipate to be rich or a celebrity after getting UC The same goes with the highly improbable really rare Uc complications yet they somehow get within our minds and nest The mortality rate with UC is the same as the general population due to modern medical care Sepsis from intestinal perforation from severe inflammation or infection from excessive immunosuppressive toxic megacolon and the types of lymphoma associated with UC meds are all very rare and very treatable with access to modern medical care A very few amount have died due to UC but its extremely rare unless somebody refuses hospitilization and doctors suggested treatment Ceetainly its good for us to be aware of such things know what tgey mean and when theyre likely to occur and suggest it to our doctors I would never suggest anybody to wear a set of rosarybeeds for constantly worrying about every single possible

c24431a7c3700eab2d07eaff22b88ca8d68cc627,Different insurances approve different things at different times Im convinced a lot of the approval process has to do with the mood the insurance person is in when they approvedeny your request I think some follow up things for you to look at would be 1 Is the insurance company going to always deny it or will they approve it after you have tried other medications and they dont work For my insurance they wouldnt approve Entyvio until I tried either Remicade or Humira I went on Humira it didnt work and then insurance approved Entyvio Try to find out if the insurance just has a process to follow or if they will never approve it 2 See if your doctor will call on your behalf I know my doctor told me when we first applied for Humira that if they deny the nurses request he will call the insurance company and get it approved It never came to that but he said a lot of times doctors have a better chance at getting something approved that originally gets denied,entyvio
3cdd0ef61b4a8f9b24ca69a65cfea0d3fac82f05,Reply posted for AmandaKaye09 I dont feel like I can give good advice but I can tell you my experience First it is getting harder to get doctors to prescribe pain meds with the whole opioid crisis  I felt awkward asking for it but when my UC got worse I did need it However he shouldnt need it all the time if his UC is being controlled For me I used hydrocodine while waiting for entyvio to kick in And even then I made sure to use it wisely I would take it at night so that I could rest comfortably but during the day I only took it if things were so bad that I needed to stay home Now that things are improving I only take a half at night occasionally For his back there are non narcotic options Like prescription lidocaine patches etc Smoking is addictive too and some people simply have an addictive personality or addictive gene I guess Youre right to be honest with his drs and it sounds like you really want whats best for him I had a friend whos husband was addicted to pills he would lie but somehow she was able to get a copy of prescriptions filled by him since it was on her insurance policy She told him it was rehab or divorce Has he had a scope recently to show if his UC is still bad That might give you answers but I hope things improve for you It sounds like hes had a hard time and he might need to talk to a professional to get himself together,entyvio

ac915e1141f7a76c1ae1eb99498bf680e0fd402a,So its been a while since my last update Had my 4th infusion about 4 weeks ago Mainly doing very well Two weeks ago I had a dull ache in my abdomen all day and again the next day It left me feeling tired and yucky At the time Id been doing so well I was cutting back on the Uceris foam and nightly Canasa I think Id gone 23 nights without Canasa So I stepped those back up and started the Uceris foam in the morning and Canasa at night The pain shifted to my lower left and sharper for a few days and then went away Havent used the Uceris foam for about 4 days now but still doing Canasa nightly Ive had a headache since Sunday night Forehead and top of head again feeling very stuffedup this morning but no its not a cold its the headache Even considered if it was a sinus headacheinfection I took a migraine pill Sunday night and when I woke the next day still had the headache so I took another one and that worked But then I woke up with it again this morning Didnt want to take a nother pill since that would be 3 in only a day and a half but it kept getting worse and the nausea was getting pretty bad so I did It went away but I dont feel all that well Wondering now if the headaches are related to Entyvio or possibly one of my other meds I think my antidepressant can cause headaches and I think Apriso can too If this sucker is back in the morning I will call my neurologist and go in to see him I saw him last month but hadnt been logging my headaches Now I am I dont get them every day probably every 2 weeks but whew these last few days have not been good I cant function when I have them Anyway Entyvio  Im a little worried that Im not in complete remission yet Its been 3 12 months but I know they say to give it 6 months for full effects and on the whole Im really doing well Ive had a little bit of urgency when I have to have a BM but nothing like before Down to 1 maybe 2 BMs a day but theyre soft and a little loose sometimes The last few days have been more but my headaches and the migraine meds tend to do that to me Overall I can live with my UC few symptoms here and there Hoping I continue to improve after my next infusion and that the headaches arent caused by Entyvio No way to tell for sure though UC pancolitis DX March 2016 Partial Colectomy for diverticulitis Sept 2014 Apriso 375 g x 4day Canasa  Uceris foam as needed Supplements Zinc Lglutamine Probiotics Reuteri pearls VSL 3 Folic Acid CoQ10 turmeric boswellia milk thistle NAC reservatol colostrum glycine Started Entyvio 32917 Constant flares since March 2016 only relieved by Prednisone,entyvio

full colonoscopy was end of june which showed leftsided colitis to 40cm feb 2018 28cm perhaps calling it proctitis is sloppy although thats what my dr is calling it but its the rectum which is badly ulcerated and giving me the symptoms which impact my life higher up is only red with mild inflammation I saw it myself during the rectoscope as soon as you go above the rectum the ulcers disappear and it looks much more healthy Also i had so many scopes i have learned to correlate my symptoms with whats happening inside my colon and my symptoms now are significantly better than when i had the scope with 28cm inflammation So if we wanted to be really strict its most likely a proctosigmoiditisi have solid BMs and dont see blood since i started xeljanz Just the mornings i am restricted by urgency and sometimes the pain bothers me throughout the day although right now i have no pain Sometimes i think it would be good just to get the whole thing out then i dont have to worry about it any more I have a really restricted diet and pretty sure surgery would allow me to eat more things that i really miss At the same time it is very counter intuitive to voluntarily remove a major organ And i honestly would not have considered my situation to be bad enough to require surgery if my dr didnt keep recommending it For now hes made an appointment for me to talk to a surgeon about how the surgery works Then also the ostomy nurse Then we meet again in 4 weeks to discuss As long as my symptoms dont escalate its a non urgent case DX pancolitis 2015 Last remission 2016 Moderately severe

what you could expect if surgery became inevitable but it sounds like youre doing fairly well at the moment and its not something worth considering I was thinking earlier about whether I would wish I hadnt had surgery if there was suddenly a cure and I dont think I would feel that way simply because I would have lost the past 5 years ive been living med free and free of symptoms Nothing will bring back the lost time not even a working colon I hope for a cure for all the sufferers but I personally live quite well postsurgery Even better than many live while in remission considering the dietary restrictions the expense the time implication of seeing doctors and having procedures the implication of drugs on your body the loss of predictability the loss of confidence in yourself being able to work or travel I cant see living like that I feel like I am free again My GI always called mine proctitis too Interesting how they always want to minimize it I think mine really wanted to believe

but toward the end I was basically not eating for a day to make it through working in the mornings I also have to factor in how much time I was spending between preparing crazy foods and trying dietssupplments to going to doctor appointments I was going to various doctors quite frequently between the tests and treatments I was also spending A LOT on this stuff I hit my max out of pocket every year The real clincher for me was the prednisone I had gained weight and I was unhappy with my appearance plus it has longterm consequences When I was finally off it I promised myself never again  and I knew surgery was the only want to potentially avoid it forever I have to say I dont appreciate eating whatever I want as much as I should Its like I completely forgot I lived all those years without any bad foods and bad was everything from coffee to beans to chocolate to dairy It was literally whatever I irrationally thought was bad that day or week or year I went 10 years thinking the food was problematic Never did any diet do much unless I avoided food entirely Take it easy and see how you do Maybe you will be 100 in a few weeks and stay that way forever with xeljanz Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones where the diet suddenly becomes the magic bullet you never know Maybe another drug or clinical trial will come along and you will have it in you to give it another 6 months to a year of trying Just dont give up 8 years like I did It was at such a bad time for me too I definitely would have advanced much further in my career if I were able to be more present

114a29af2ed287a37612544247aa658cc3dedba7,First of all thank you Barnsbury for sharing I had asked my GI who also participated in trials the longest shed seen someone on it successfully and she said 5 years so thats interesting to hear how long you made it Im two weeks out from my next infusion but wanted to post an update for transparency Ive been having D on and off for a few weeks It started with a salad I ateI shared it with someone who did not get sick but that gave me some bad gas nausea and D for a couple days Figured I picked a little bug It got better until I get my period and the D started up again also not unusual but very severe this timemy period was more heavy than usual so hoping it was correlated Its been on and off since though Ill say it doesnt feel very UClike It feels more in like something going on in my stomach than my lower GI tract Also Ive been eating kale salads and other  foods SO not the best diet choices  I also dont have the fatigue or aches or pain associated with a flare Im traveling for the next two weeks which generally makes me a bit more constipated so well see how it goes I will update after my next infusion and will be asking for bloodwork to check inflammation to see if theres a noticeable change post infusion 27 dxd in 2007 1st Entyvio infusion 82015 responding very well Currently Entyvio Colazal Florastor VSL 3 Previously Apriso Hair Loss Flagyl Prednisone Mesalamine Enemas Tinidazole Align Lialda Imuran Allergic Asacol Ineffective Remicade Allergic Humira Ineffective Anusol Canasa Cortifoam,entyvio

9318444680e880f0a00279669a132adbacefb960,I dont think a cure will be found sadly but everyone saying meds havent changed in 25 years wasnt Remicade approved for UC no longer than 10 years ago or so That has put a lot of people in remission And as far as I understand Entyvio is also fairly new within a few years which has helped a good many people HepC used to be where no one had anything to really help as far as I understand and then within the last 10 years theyve made enough progress to where a medicine will now pretty much treat it no problems I dont need a cure as long as theres a medication that can put me in permanent remission no problem thats good enough for me,entyvio
b6a4d7da78f56ed54f28836d6e4caebd1a38235d,Im assuming the 10mgkg every 6 weeks is limited by your insurance Because my doctor has assured me that she doses people up to 15mgkg every 4 weeks although I would probably have to fight to the grave to get insurance to cover it As for adding an immunomodulator it will not only potentially directly help treat your UC but it will also help the remicade work better and allow you to maintain higher infliximab trough levels I would give it a shot before you switch biologicsdrugs as whatever you switch to may not work at all Bridgeing to another drug would be hard if you are refractory to steroids as entyvio takes a while to work if it does at all so you would probably have to try bridging to it with tacrolimus The other option would be to just switch to xeljanz Post Edited Curious Crapper  1142019 72010 PM GMT7,entyvio
f164d1cfdb8122cf0b1f10b8d4c5218628d04aa0,Reply posted for nygirl Great question My 2015 was complicated I had a postsurgical blood clot and then chronic bleeding with blood thinners That summer I was beginning to feel better but was having terrible night sweats I had a routine colonoscopy in August and although my symptoms were pretty mild the anastomosis looked according to my GI like a drawstring bag We didnt do anything for awhile until a PET scan revealed more inflammatory problems that would have been tougher to evaluate tonsils and behind my sternum and continued night sweats After ruling out basically every infectious disease we removed another foot of intestine The rest of my symptoms disappeared quickly after that Im pretty positive they didnt remove everything the first time or the way the anastomosis was constructed aggravated the tissue to the point that it was symptomatic even though I was in remission by biopsy The november 2015 surgery resulted in an incisional hernia that I finally had repaired this past October 2017 and I am doing so so much better Ive been on entyvio since fall 2014,entyvio

30839d9ea5fdd0369ead66abec3fe56f0f8cba95,Urgh Had chilli con carne for dinner followed by a massive slice of Lotus biscoff cheesecake  Sadly they were at war with my guts two hours later  Karen  Im sorry about your older sister Sadly its pretty common for siblings to become hostile to one another instead of combining forces against the abusive parents It happened to me I was the youngest of 4 children Bullied throughout childhood by my older brothers nobody to stop it or to boost my selfesteem apparently at the age of 5 I walked around at a family BBQ telling family members that everyone hated me and nobody liked me  it was apparently taken from Charlie Brown in the Peanuts comic strip I dont remember that but I do remember strongly identifying with Charlie Brown when I was a few years older Dear god what a role model to pick but there must have been a reason why he resonated so strongly with me Anyway yeah There are various reasons why siblings undermine one another Sometimes the parents encourage it by picking scapegoats and golden children Other times its easier for children to lash at anyone else except their parents the people in the world they most depend on Either way its pretty unlikely that any child will escape unscathed from an abusive or neglectful upbringing there will be scars if not physical then emotional and mental I did have long periods of quiet at home and in those days no TV or internet to distract me There wasnt that much else for me to do in my bedroom apart from read  and so I read But if you were brought up in a continuously unsafe environment Im not surprised you couldnt focus enough to read Trina  Oh god I have a constant feeling of being alone in this world Like you my mother wasnt a hugger My memory isnt good enough to say she never hugged me but I dont remember ever being hugged at least not as an older child I really remember virtually nothing before the age of 8 or 9 I always felt alone and like I didnt matter to anyone or anything From childhood I remember that feeling it was a constant presence Spring is my favourite time of year too By late summer Ive had enough and just want the dark evenings and crisp weather back again but now everything is fresh and new Put like that selfcompassion seems more doable I really cant do the whole looking at myself in a mirror and telling myself I love myself bit  I can barely stand to look at myself in the mirror most of the time let alone declare out loud that I love myself But I could try and challenge the negative thought loops thankfully they havent been that bad today Myself  Yeah the eye inflammation is called uveitis every opthamologist Ive seen has told me its linked to the Crohns The steroid drops bosh the inflammation on the head for a little while but I cant get off them for longer than a few days before it comes back The steroid drops have their own list of complications and I am anxious about what will happen if I cannot get the uveitis into remission Im seriously thinking of asking my GI if I can switch from Entyvio to a systemic biologic which could reach the eye inflammation  Entyvio wont reach it It kind of sounds like you chose to turn a blind eye to your BFs crushes which I dont think I could do Having female friends is okay making a particular female your muse BBF and confidante not so much I dunno about Hes wife I rather suspect she chose to turn a blind eye to it too but He also could have lied to me about telling her everything suspect the truth is somewhere halfway between those two points As for me I am trying to avoid dwelling on bitterness but I cannot help feeling a bit used at least Because I was wasnt I My BFF turned out in the end to be my BFUTSHTF My Best Friend Until The  Hit The Fan Oh well at least Ive still got my good female friend And HW of course p Goodnight folks Post Edited By Moderator iPoop  5152018 20309 PM GMT6,entyvio
1aa7dde5dc5249ebc3490c1fbac6ca6df48753a2,Have you had blood testing done to check your levels of Humira at trough What dose are you taking and how often Before giving up on Humira and switching to something else you should make sure youre giving Humira its best chances to work And that often means increased dose andor increased frequency of injection It also may mean combining it with an immunomodulator like imuran or 6mp or methotrexate Only after all that should you consider Humira a failure necessitating a switch As for Entyvio it doesnt just work in the colon It works in the small bowel and the colon Data so far seems to show it works quite well for UC and fairly well for Crohns But if I were you Id max out all options with Humira before giving up on it and switching to something else whether Entyvio or Remicade or any of the others,entyvio
